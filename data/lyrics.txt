Can't you see I'm trying?
I don't even like it. I just lied to
Get to your apartment, now I'm staying
Here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this... it?
Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable children
Trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind them
Oh dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me
We're not enemies; We just disagree
If I was like him all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree
I think we should disagree, yeah
Is this it
Is this it
Is this it
Can't you see I'm trying?
I don't even like it. I just lied to
Get to your apartment, now I'm staying
Here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go, oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'm leaving
Our fears are different here
We train in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now, but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go
Darling let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Leaving just in time
Staying for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So this is why I'm leaving
Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sun beams
Losing against their dreams
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
Let's go
When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
And I'll be there, he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them
Well I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling, let me go
Tried it once and they like it
Then tried to hide it
Says, I've been doing this 25 years
But I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah
Oh, but that's it
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trench coat?
I should've worked much harder
I should've just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
Something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work; you'll be on time
These little problems they're not yours and mine,
Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothin' I wanted, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothing
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, Oh, you're a freak
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
For the record it's between you and I
Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it just don't make any sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trench coat?
I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothin'
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
And for the record, it's between you and I
In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darlin', your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wastin' no more time
And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So, I
Sometimes
Say, Fate my friend
You say the strangest things
I find, sometimes
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Say I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darlin', your head's not right
See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time
No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa says, 
Take time for me
Dropping him down to his knees
Ah, chest down
Take me away
See I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
Oh, 
You drink too much
Makes me drink just the same
People tried 
Felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice
He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then in dollars makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care
'Cause
I am with you
Now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
You drink too much
Makes me drink just the same
The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last
We all like it a little different
Last night she said,
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh it turns me off,
When I feel left out
So I, I turn around,
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure,
I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles
See, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night she said,
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off,
When I feel left out
So I, I turn around
Oh, baby, gonna be alright.
It was a great big lie
Cause I left that night, yeah
Oh, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night she said,
Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off,
When I feel left out
So I, I turn around
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure,
I'm walking out that door, yeah
Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
Oh, we shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame
Says we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right things, but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I watch the TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right it's true
Says he can't decide
I shake my head to say
Everything's just great
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember
Raised in Carolina, she says
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back
I say the right things but act the wrong way
I like it right here but I cannot stay
I watch the TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
Oh, man, can't you see I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice, so I can be mean
I miss the last bus, we take the next train
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, Thanks my friend, but he was too late
Oh why, oh why
I don't know
So you think things move pretty fast down here
Well just wait my dear till you look up there
Oh maybe someday you'll know
Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well dressed cause he hates to fly
Oh loves his job, takes it home
Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it
Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, 
Thanks my friend, thought that we was dead
Oh why, oh why
I don't know
Think things move pretty fast down here
But just wait my dear till we get up there
Oh maybe someday they'll know
Come on tell me does she warm the room
When he comes
Or does he just know how to leave
When it gets cold
Well I don't care, I don't care
Cause it's free
You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before
I know
They sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's OK
No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap
And storefronts rarely changed
At least I'm on my own again
Instead of anywhere with you
But, to me, it's all the same
And I lost my page 
Again
I know this is surreal
But, I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Well, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh oh
Let's see what is for sale
He's trying hard to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
They last for just one night, and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends
No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
They're trapped
I can't be there in time
I'll think about that
And I lost my page again
I know this is surreal
But, I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Well, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh oh
Leave me alone
I'm in control
I'm in control
And girls lie too much
And boys act too tough
Enough is enough
Well, on the minds
Of other men
I know she was
I said 
Just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it
That's right
Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna break your back for a chance
He's gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday
I fell off the track, now
I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys lie too much
Girls act too tough
Enough is enough
Well on the minds
Of other girls
I know he was
I said
Just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it
That's right
Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna break your back for a chance
He's gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday
Oh, he will
Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending
In the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you to say
No
Let me go, oh, let me go
Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow it is different
So I'll pretend, I'll pretend I'm leaving
Our fears are different here
We train in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now, but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
Too many varieties
Well, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go
Oh, let me go
Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow it is different
So this is why I'm leaving
Last night, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh it turns me off,
When I feel left out
So I walked out
Little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just now fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles
And people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your Grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand
Last night, she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cause I left that night, yeah
Oh it's alright, baby
Yeah!
And people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And on top of this ain't ever gonna understand
Last night, she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I turned around
Little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck
Oh his strange manners, I love 'em so
I wish you'd wear your new trench coat
I don't show up on weekdays
That's something that you learned yesterday
I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
You ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothing
I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
I took five dollars, won't get me far
My last resort is to steal your car
Drive you to work; you'll be on time
These little problems they're not yours and mine,
Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothing
And all he said is, 
I'm a freak
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone he keeps asking for more
Together again, like the beginning
But for the record it's between you and me
I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
Oh, his strange manners I love them so
Why won't he wear his new trenchcoat?
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister don't give a fuck
I just want to turn you down
And maybe later I'll turn you around
You ain't never had nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothing
And all he said is, 
I'm a freak
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone he just asks for more
Together again, like the beginning
I said it's between you and I
I want to be forgotten
and I don't want to be reminded
You say please don't make this harder
No, I won't yet
I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say please don't make this harder
No, I won't yet
Oh dear, is it really all true?
Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?
Top ten ideas for countdown shows
Whose culture is this and does anybody know?
I wait and tell myself life ain't chess,
But no one comes in and yes, you're alone
You don't miss me, I know
Oh Tennessee, what did you write?
I come together in the middle of the night
Oh that's an ending that I can't write, cause
I've got you to let me down
I want to be forgotten
and I don't want to be reminded
You say please don't make this harder
No, I won't yet
I want to be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say please don't make this harder
No, I won't yet
He seemed impressed by the way you came in
Tell us a story
I know you're not boring
I was afraid that you would not insist
You sound so sleepy
just take this, now leave me
I said please don't slow me down
If I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town
Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road
The wait is over
I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough
Now every time that I look at myself
I thought I told you
this world is not for you
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
you sound so angry
just calm down, you found me
I said please don't slow me down
If I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town
Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough,
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road,
The wait is over
I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough
So many fish there in the sea
I wanted you, you wanted me
That's just a phase, it's got to pass
I was a train moving too fast
Didn't understand what to see
Yeah, then I got a different view
It's you 
no
Wait, I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend
I never was
I said wait, I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend
I never was
no
So many fish there in the sea
She wanted him, he wanted me
That's just a phase, it's got to pass
I was a train moving too fast
Yeah, I know you warned me
But this is too important
Now I got a different view
It's you
Why can't you wait?
I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend
I never was
I said wait
I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend
I never was
Talk to me now I'm older
Your friend told you cause I told her
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me
We could go and get 40s
Fuck goin' to that party
Oh really, your folks are away now?
Alright, let's go, you convinced me
12:51 is the time my voice
Found the words i sought
Is it this stage I want?
The world is shutting out
for us
We were tense for sure
But we was confident
Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me
We'd go out and get 40s
Then we'd go to some party
Oh really, your folks are away now
Alright I'm coming
I'll be right there
Now we're out of time
I said it's my fault
It's my fault
Can't make good decisions
It won't stop
I can't stop
Give me some time
I just need a little time
Give me some time
I just need a little time
Give me some time
I just need a little time
Give me some time
I just need a little time
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end
hey
We don't get the news
He says why not?
Why not?
Forget what you heard
Cause it won't stop
it won't stop
Give 'em some time
They just need a little time
Give 'em some time 
They just need a little time
Give 'em some time 
They just need a little time
Give 'em some time 
They just need a little time
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end as you know it
You're not supposed to say that
you taught me too much
Is this how it ends?
Is this how it ends?
Watched her as she wiped her eyes
You don't make me sorry
Now I know
That you never listened
Listen
Thinking about that high school dance
Worrying about the finals
Yes I know
You're feeling lonely
Oh lonely, so lonely
Never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now
Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me
I said I was fine,
It's just the second time
We lost the war
She'd be in the kitchen
I would start the fire
Those days are gone
But you know I can't give up
Give up
PS if i may ask why
When will they get tired
We've stayed up
All night trying
Trying
Never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now
Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me
I said I was fine
The second time
We lost the war
When they say promises
They mean promises
They'd say, that's ok,
Long as we can celebrate
You see, my uncle would say
things would change when he's dead
Meet me in the bathroom
That's what she said
I don't mind
it's true
Never was on time
Yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago
And darling, I don't mind
Yeah, we were just two friends in lust
And baby, that just don't mean much
You trained me not to love
After you showed me what it was
Now she's staring wide-eyed
Can't close her eyes
Anywhere is fine
just don't waste my time
You see, my uncle would say
things would change once he's dead
Meet me in the bathroom
That's what she said
I don't mind
it's true
Never was on time
Yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago
And darling, I don't mind
Yeah, they were just two fucks in lust
Baby, that just don't mean much
You trained me not to love
After you taught me what it was
I don't want to waste your time
I don't want to waste your time
I just want to say
I've got to say
We worked hard, darling
We don't have no control
We're under control
I don't want to do it your way
I don't want to do it your way
I don't want to give it to you, your way
I don't want to know
I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to change the world
I just want to watch it go by
I just want to watch you go by
We were young, darling
We don't have no control
We're out of control
I don't want to do it your way
I don't want to do it your way
I don't want to give it to you, your way
I don't want to know
I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to waste your time
I just want to know you're alright
I've got to know you're alright
You are young, darling
For now, but not for long
Under control
She was still sleeping, the problem will stay
One more day
Said she's not sorry the wind blows her way
Accidents happen, there's one planned today
Oh you see
I wish it was not true
But that's the way it is
It's not your fault
That's the way it is
I'm sick of you
And that's the way it is
And will always be
Wednesday is over, it's over again
Said my goodbyes to the life we won't spend
Together
I wish it was not true
But that's the way it is
It's not your fault
That's the way it is
I'm sick of you
And that's the way it is
But that's not your problem
That's not a problem
That's not my problem
That's not your problem
One by one, ticking time bombs won
It's not the secret of the government
That's keeping you dumb
Oh, it's the other way around - wait
What's that sound?
One by one, baby, here they come
He wants it easy; he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward, then three steps back
Alright
Won't you take a walk outside?
Oh no
Can't you find some other guy?
Oh no
One nine six nine what's that sound?
Oh no
Keeping down the underground
Oh no
The end has no end the end has no end
The end has no end the end has no end
He want it easy; he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward, then three steps back
It won't be easy
Won't you take a walk outside?
Oh no
Can't you find another guy?
Oh no
One nine six three what's that sound?
Oh no
Keeping down the underground
Oh no
The end has no end the end has no end
The end has no end the end has no end
The end has no end the end has no end
The end has no end the end has no end
That was you up on the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
One, two tries won't do it
You do it all your life and you never get through it
Everything they had to say
Had been erased in just one day
Good try
We don't like it
Good try
We won't take that shit
I can't win
Things in bars that people do
When no one wants to talk to you
Failing can be quite a breeze, he
Told me that these girls were easy
Happy that you said you'd mount me
Felt unlucky when you found me
Some nights come up empty handed
Yes, I'll take it
Wait now
By the sidewalk
Hold on
Yes, I'll be right back
I can't win
Yeah, I
Wait for something
Cool it
We won't take that shit
Good try
We don't like it
Hold on,
Yes, I'll be right back
Ooooooo-ooooo-ooooooh 
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others they seem so very nice nice nice nice, oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no
Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like, oh
Twenty ways to see the world, oh
Twenty ways to start a fight, oh
Oh don't, don't, don't get up, I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby cause I'm through
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you
Ooooooo-ooooo-ooooooh 
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man, oh
Not even one requires a plan, I know
Countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose, oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
This I've tried and now refuse, oh
Oh don't, don't, don't get up, I can't see the sunshine
Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby cause I'm through
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you, alright
Shut me up, shut me up up up up up
And I'll get along with you
Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you messed up
When I saw you
You're cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
Nobody can see me
Everything's too easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action she said
Why won't you come over here?
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Old time loves don't
Die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while it was nice
But it's time to say bye
I'm cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
No no no cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
Oh no no no no cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
Well I don't feel better
When I'm fucking around
And I don't write better
When I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson
'Cause I've already learned
Yeah, the sun will be shining
And my children will burn
Oh the heart beats in its cage
I don't want what you want
I don't feel what you feel
See I'm stuck in a city
But I belong in a field
Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone
Oh the heart beats in its cage
All our friends they're laughing at us
All of those you loved, you mistrust
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
Look around there's no one else left
I went to the concert
And I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited
When I thought you were around
Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, left, left, left
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Yes the heart beats in its cage
Alright
And the heart beats in its cage
Oh, razorblade, that's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down, it gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything
You've got to take me out at least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now but in your heart it's loud
Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry, let it go
Oh, the razorblade, wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hands or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything
He would never talk but he was not shy
She was a street smart girl but she could not lie
They were perfect for each other, say it now
Cause in your heart it's loud
Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry, hey
Sweetheart, your feelings are more important of course, of course
Everyone that wanted everything that we would take from them
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
No, don't, okay
I'm tired of everyone I know
Of everyone I see on the street and on TV
On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side
I hate them all, I hate them all
I hate myself for hating them
So I'll drink some more, I'll love them all, I'll drink even more
I'll hate them even more than I did before
On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side
I remember when you came
You told me how to sing
Now it seems so far away
You told me how to sing
I'm tired of being so judgmental of everyone
And when the ghosts sleep, I will train my eyes to see
And my mind is as wide as the bird's on a tree
On the other side, on the other side
I know what's waiting for me on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
I know you're waiting for me on the other side
Sing me a song you could be
Tell me a tale just like me
Don't turn it my way, happy and free
I'll turn it to shit, happy and free
Oh, all that I do, is wait for you
All that I do, is wait for you
I can't get along, with all your friends
Don't know how to act, that's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change but not in what way
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
I am not you, we could have
I'm almost through, great success
It's about time such a success
That you came through at no expense
Oh, all that I do, is wait for you
All that I do, is wait for you
I can't get away from all your friends
I'm not coming back, that's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change but not in what way
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
Right, wrong, what to do
Someday it will come to you
Hostile Indians, we named a summer camp for you
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothing to say
Harmless children, we named our soldiers after you
Don't be a coconut
God is trying to talk to you
We could drag it out but that's for other bands to do
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy
I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead
But I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
Oh, I'll kill to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy
Oh with strangers to impress so near
Old friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I pretend I had the perfect ear
Take me to the water
Make me understand that I was wrong
For me tomorrow is my first day
So please don't tempt me in the wrong way
It's almost after midnight
I can see the city lights, we're here
Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio
Well I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that I'll just borrow
All the chords from that song
And all the words from that other song
I heard yesterday
Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio
I will not disturb you
I was just returning you the compliment
Say a prayer now, don't be scared now
You don't want trouble, well we might get some
We might get some, it's troublesome
But don't you worry, you can't help me
Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies
First you're worried, then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same
That's impossible, before I let you go, let me look at you
Don't you worry, you will help me
Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies
Oh yes I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
Oh yes I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
You're mineHow did anybody find out where I was?
How did anybody find that out?
I was hiding from the world, I was a squirrel
But you chopped down my tree to get my fur
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, the fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Oh fear of sleep, can't you wait, I'm not done
Fear of sleep, here you come, fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
'Cause everybody is drunk, loud and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else, other than yourself
But you know trying to hold back on being an asshole helps
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, where'd you go? Fear of sleep
Oh fear of sleep, so you know, I'm not done
Here we go, here you come, fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no funIt was all just a dream, oh no
Yet I wish it was real
All my pets they were there and they smiled
Take a shit, it was fine
Everybody so inviting
They've got it in for me I know
It's not that I don't really love you
It's just that I don't really know
The hateful things you think you want to say
Time will turn them into jokes, yup
Yes, it was all just a dream, oh no
Was it real? I don't know I hope so
Here we go, can I play? Can I watch?
You would like one more night in your life
I saw words in your star and I cussed
It goes fast, I got sunk every shot
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care
This whole life
Is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up and I wait and I fall
I will call you up one day
Overjoyed in a case
First time around, second take so long
Third time's a charm, second falls
Five days to rehearse, six American work
Seven is in a scale, eight circum change
Nine events a case, ten is you and friend
Eleven seconds there because twelve make it go large
I think I know what you mean but watch what you say
Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?
Your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud
You're sad but you smile, it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change, it's the muscles around your eyes
An egg to fertilize, a pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize, a life to scrutinize
A child to criticize, young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize, generations to desensitize
Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live as free
And detached as boats to the dock?
Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?
Night after night you turn off the light
You don't fall asleep, right away, are we, are we done?
A desk to organize, a product to advertise
A market to monopolize, movie stars you idolize
Leaders to scandalize, enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize, fury to tranquilize
Weapons to synchronize, cities to vaporize
They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
Encourage and derange you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna make your heart in
Break you heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer, miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do nothing? Me too
All actors they're pretending and singers they will sometimes lie
Oh kids are always honest cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
You're the pretty smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
In the evening sun
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation that has nothing to say
How'd you make your way to me?
Oh, let's say you made a deal with me
And I got your name and your home address
You're all trashed up with your big red belt
I would almost say that you might need help
I could drop you off at the next red light
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right
All the girls could never make me love them the way I love you
Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more?
I can see the elevator crash through the floor
I can still see yesterday sailing away
Seven billion people who got nothing to say
Are you coming on to me?
I saw your face then I heard that song
It was so inviting it hurt my bones
Well it looks like you but your eyes are gray
And your hair is gone but your minds okay
I like your smile but your foreheads cold
I don't want you to be afraid and go
I would cheat and lie and steal
I was there on the nail for you
I was waiting for my baby to arrive right by my side
Oh please, leave me alone tonight, forget the past
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Oh, you know I said it just to get you to laugh
Do it for the people that have die for your sake
An entire generation of entertainers to blame
The light is red, the camera's on
Get yourself a lawyer and a gun
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone
Childhood's end can be so competitive
Oh, the sky's not the limit and your never gonna guess what is, oh
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice
Selling your body to the street
Selling your girlfriend's to the night for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that
Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Platinum's on the rise
Playboys in disguise
I'm just trying' to find
A mountain I can climb
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice
And now you see that
Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Porn's on the rise
Psychos in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb
Darling, aren't you gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence
I didn't want to ask you baby
I didn't want you to have to ask anybody baby
Is anybody asking maybe?
Can anyone even hear me?
Why are you waiting beyond the door?
Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just trying to find
A nice place for you and ISlip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We got the right cause they'll fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
But I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's singing the same song for ten years
I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?
And they sacrifice their lives
And they're lying about those odds
Oh, they've said it a billion times and they'll say it again
So long my adversary and friend
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning, yelling
No more
So long, my friend and adversary
I'll be waiting for youHappiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one's discipline
One's devotion, one's just a ring
Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy
Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
and the world is all cousins not brothers
Hard to take you off of my love
One's an instant, one takes some will
One gives life, and one makes you kill
One's the means and ones for the end
Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy
Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
and the world is all cousins not brothers
Don't you give in
You're beginning
Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened
If you like
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Every night
What are the reasons
What are the reasons
What are the reasons
To fall out
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
Nothing
Girl, I am on
At anytime
Girl, I want at any town
I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
Hello, forest
I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
Something more
Yeah
I don't want to fight
Don't want it, baby
You and me
I don't want to fight
Don't wanna make
You and me
I don't want to fight
Don't wanna make
You and me
I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
If you want
I want a 
If I could
Sister, it feels like just yesterday,
Sister, don't you forget my number, on the door
You've got something and it's so good to see,
Something wonderful that I could not be
Everybody hanging on for their lives,
But you can't help them cause you don't have the time
I know, everyone goes any damn place they like
I hope this goes over well, on the toxic radio
Yeah
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind.
That's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now.
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken for a fool all the time
I don't know why
Blame yourself for once, quit putting it on me
I can't help you cause I've seen what it means,
It's so early I don't want to wake up
We're so lucky cause we never grew up
Mama, it feels like just yesterday
Mama, don't you forget my number?
I don't want to be the one at the door
I know, everyone goes any damn place they choose
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio
A tourist in the ghetto, not afraid of anything
Except death and anything else that could maybe hurt the most 
Yeah
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
That's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
I don't know why
With all the noise above
He tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day has just begun
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
The diamond cuts her eye
The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now, they hear it loud
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
I'm okay, I'm alright
I was out late last night
Empty world, empty world
I will wait one more night
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Wooah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
Wait time is to blame
Mapped out fame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you
And you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground
Waking up is so much fun to do
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
An 80's movie make out party with you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
Oh b-baby, don't you be so mad because I barely remember
And she tries to recognize me with the eyes she saw me with in December
And she's starting to realize that it's actually not a good thing
And it's so tough because you're down to go out again and have another adventure
All her friends in the alleyway shout back, but she can't hear them
But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
Get up in the morning and run
You'll be frustrated till the day that you're done
He got punched in the mouth for sticking his nose in other people's business
No good solution, always on the verge of some revolution
Well tough luck it may take a thousand years but I think we can do it
Best friends fight, but they never enjoy life as good as when they abuse it
He said the soldier is a necessity in light of all the failures of man
But you're never gonna get their love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone
He could never mention it out here and now
Without quick tears in his eyes
And you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone
Oh you're never gonna get this love
We can roll around in the dark
That's about as far as we go
Get up in the morning and run
I want to be outrageous
But inside I know I'm plain
So plain, just plain
Always, in pain?
Silently obsessed with it
Just like anyone I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial
I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you, like you, like you
Like you, instead of me
Silently obsessed with it
Just like anyone I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial
Animals on TV singing about some pain that they once felt
There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone
So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way
Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some pain they felt at some point
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous
What's the point?
As I watched the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears
He is coming from a part of hell
Where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
He can tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction of routine as well
Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
Is a crime, just like Cornel West might say
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way
They found our city under the water
Gotta get my hands on something new
You don't want to be without this
Something isn't adding up
Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
Cause I don't know why
Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name
They found our city under the water
I began to listen to your eyes
You don't want to live without it
Even others, they'd abide
Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name
Someone
I didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name
Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
Cause I don't know why
I don't listen
And I don't speak
Well, it's a talent
I don't know why
Those that try anything once
Should we care about the only ones?
All the time that I need is never quite enough
All the time that I have is all that's necessary
You're livin' a lie
You're livin' a lie
You're living too fast
You gotta pray for the best
You never ask why
You never ask why
You're living a lie
Baby you're flying too high
No one talks, about the war
On my block, or by the shore
All alone in a room
Do you want what I want too?
All the time in the world
Is all that's necessary
You're livin' a lie
You're livin' a lie
You're living too fast
You gotta pray for the best
You never ask why
You never ask why
You're living a lie
Baby you're flying too high
You never ask why
You never ask why
You're livin' a lie
Baby you're flying too high
Don't get on the phone
Don't reach for the door
You know the answer that you're looking for
You're livin' a lie
You're livin' a lie
You're living too fast
You gotta pray for the best
You never ask why
You never ask why
You're livin' a lie
Baby you're flying too high
One two, three
Get dressed in your bed
While she's asleep
It isn't right
But it isn't hard
Tell me, tell me won't you understand
Show me, show me, show me a better plan
It's summer lies
It's someone else's nothing
Here it comes now
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
But there's a million reasons to leave
Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down
Please, please don't point it that way
It's just a trigger that goes once
And you'll be unafraid
I wish that I'd been noticed, but it never goes that way
The silence that you brought has gone, gone, gone
Tell me, tell me, won't you understand?
Show me, show me, show me
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
You ask me to stay
But there's a million reasons to leave
Show me what to say
Show me what to be
Show me what to see
Show me what to be
Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down
I don't wanna be in there with you
I don't wanna be in there without your loving either
I waited for your thoughts
Can't wait no longer
If we don't watch the sun
It will rise
If we don't take our time
It's not wise
Putting posters up
For your band (Hey, we're playing, come by)
Now I'll tear them down
With my hand
I didn't want to notice
Didn't know the gun was loaded
Didn't really know this
What kind of asshole drives a Lotus?
Come here and go get with me
I wanna see you Wednesday
Come on, come on, come over
Take it off your shoulder
Come on and pull me over
We gotta get to work now
Sliding it off your shoulder
As we're falling over
Oh, welcome to Japan!
Scuba-dancing!
Touchdown!
I didn't want to notice
Didn't know the gun was loaded
Didn't really know this
What kind of asshole drives a Lotus?
I didn't want to bore you
Didn't wanna pick up your shit for ya
I've been ready to do this
I'll be there
Come here and go get with me
I wanna see you Wednesday
Come on, come on, come over
Take it off your shoulder
Come on and pull me over
We gotta get to work now
Sliding it off your shoulder
As we're falling over
You did it alone
You did it for fun
You did it for everyone who's on the run
You're not just a friend
You'll be born again
We'll be in this race until the very end
He lives on the phone
He cheats on his clone
You'll never believe me 'til you're on your own
Comes in once a month
And he never leaves
He said he is broken
Yet he lives free
Didn't wanna floor ya
I didn't wanna be there for ya
Didn't wanna warn ya
I'll be there
It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, you never try
Anymore
Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world closed down
But, you caught it
Get back inside
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
I tried to believe in it
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night?
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
Run away
So please
Run away
Runaway
Why's she telling me the story of her life?
All the things you wanna kill will give you spite
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they're doling out their wisdom in the fire
I will say
I will say don't judge me
I will say
I will say don't judge me
I wait on a darkened highway
I wait on a darkened highway
I can take as long as without looking by
Why's she telling me the story of her life
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they've thrown all their wisdom in the fire
I will say
I will say don't judge me!
I will say
I will say don't judge me
I wait on a darkened highway
I wait on a darkened highway
I will say
I will say don't judge me
I will say
I will say don't judge me
I wait on a darkened highway
I wait on a darkened highway
You don't have to be so down
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
You don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind
It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Oh, please don't tell it to my face 
Everyone can see that you were circling his space 
The next generation will forget
Where their daughter's been
Or who knows, it could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and think or hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face
Accuse - it's no ones fault
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Now, they're scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
I forgot your jacket outdoors
Day's been something
See if I care
One; it's not okayish day, just so
But yes, if you insist
Okay
Oh, alright, I know where tonight
Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they're closing? 
Might need a lawyer
Let's all be honest
Where there's a forest
We don't belong
Pleased to get who's standing around 
Life forgives you when you rebound
See, what friends locked up at the zoo
Why aren't we leaving town right now?
Oh, alright, I know where tonight
I'm on the guestlist
We got the door, but
Can't seem to find it
Pants on a tiger
Winter is white and
I won't be here buzzing
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well, leaving your tears alone
Run down your face
And escapes
Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they're closing? 
You'll need a lawyer
Let's all be honest
We're in a forest
We don't belong
I'm on the guestlist
No need to welcome
Can't seem to find it
March to the war drum
Tigers have pants on
We have no gun
Thank you for staying
What are you saying?
I won't forget
I waited for ya
I waited for ya
I waited on ya
But now I don't
You didn't see it
I didn't see it
I didn't see it
But now, oh, I do
I play your game
I play your game
Now
I play your game
I play your game
I take my chances alone
Get on your horse and be gone
I will not wait up for you anymore
So you can ask me if something is wrong
Will you go?
I don't know anymore
When the night isn't ready for you
It's a fleeting unorthodox view
They invited a stewardess, too
Now they want you to see it
Here's to days he decides he's got time
And he claims that it's not a surprise
When he finds out the truth's on his side
I take my chances alone
Get on your horse and be gone
I will not wait up for you anymore
So you can ask me if something is wrong
Will you go?
I don't know anymore
I don't believe anyone
As they crawl out of my way
Waiting for the night
Leaving night by night
You can see me travel
We could be in trouble every night
We're having a new lifeSay it all
Just get it all off your chest
Shake it up
500000 times
Say no more
We don't believe anything
Teenage angst
Come all ages
Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
Say it all
I'm not awake anymore
Change my mind
2000 times before
Seen a knight
Dance on the side of the road
Teenage angst
Come all ages
Baby, show me where to go
Some things I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
Feeling dizzy now
In the running show
All I want to see
All I want to know
Watch you as you stay
Faces at your door
Waiting for your piece
Pull the trigger please
Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
Cause I don't wanna see everybody get together
Leave these dreams alone
You don't wanna have to tell me that I wanted you go
Everybody needs a shadow, oh
Close the door
Not all the way
He don't understand
We don't understand
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
I made up more time watchin' you
You got it down now, don't you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
I made up more time watchin' you
I needed someone
I needed someone
80s people dancing, oooh
Always get it right
I'd listen but I can't tonight
I can't tonight, I can't tonight
Well, it's something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah, that's the thanks I get
I don't understand
Your fucked-up system
This sinister city
Try to sell the water
Try to sell the air
Try to sell your daughter
Try to sell her hair
We all want to watch the fight
Is it on Sunday?
Hide in a hole with a gun in your hand in front of
Someone you want dead, I guess?
Hiding in your suit
I did not know that
They're bringing me back to my past
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my
I got my head
It's just something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah, that's the thanks I get
Jail, that's what you get
Stepping to the system
Profiting from war
Fighting as the victim
Always wanting more
Trying to trick your brothers
Get them to fight it for you
I cannot believe my eyes
Darling I can tell you lies
Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
I don't know geography all that well
Yeahhh
Defying Western logic
Even if it shows you're wrong
I guess that's a classic
Been with us all along
Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a fox but think like a sheep
Wall Street
Unchain me
Cause this is my bank's advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day
Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Racing down the highway
Looking at me sideways
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
Unchain me
It's time
I know the way uptown
Unchain me
I'm waiting for the time
Get you with your pajamas on
Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Playing with his new toys
Looking at the sad boys
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
And we take 
What we like from them
And then say
What do you want from me?
Don't wait so long
Way too long
They wait too long
I can't stay awake too long
You never wait for some
Other generation
I'll wait somewhere alone
Get it in your head
Get out of my way
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
Okay, I see how it is now
You don't have time to play with me anymore
That's how it goes, I guess
Fuck the rest
Be right there, honey
I'm gonna take my time to say
Take my time today
I'm gonna take what comes my way
Take what they give me
Yeah, I want my money now
But he is not around
You better hold my money safe
What's your emergency?
And for the first time in my life
I'm gonna get myself right
Just get into trouble
Be there on the double
I place your bets this time
Just has to let it ride
I tr-I tried to take a roll
But the dice are on parole
I won't look down your dress
I bet you bend down as a test
I cannot wait to chase it all
Yeah, I saw it in my crystal ball
Friday night, the shining light
The secret for a spy
I got a better idea
I'll bet you on the side
When I get up in your face
You know it's no surprise
Ah baby, why is it so hard to read the sentence in my eyes?
And for the fourth time
Chains on your legs
I spent a while
Then decided on you
My baby doll
You ignored your life
We'll do it together
I'll be there whenever
Oh, you took a minute break
And said, "Thumbs up, they're okay"
I'm gonna watch the tidal wave
It's hard to chase away
Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhh
(Got to chase away)
(Hard to chase away)
(It's hard to chase away)Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a fox but think like a sheep
Wall Street
Unchain me
Cause this is my bank's advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day
Unchain me
It's time
I know the way uptown
Unchain me
I'm waiting for the time
Get you with your pajamas on
Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Racing down the highway
Looking at me sideways
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a fox but think like a sheep. Wall Street
Unchain me
Cause this is my bank's advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day
Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Playing with his new toys
Looking at the sad boys
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
And we take 
What we like from them
And then say
What do you want from me?
Don't wait so long
Way too long
They wait too long
I can't stay awake too long
You never wait for some

I'll wait somewhere alone
Get it in your head
Get out of my way
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
They've been sayin', you're sophisticated
They're complaining, over-educated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify, and shame us
We can't help it, if we are a problem
We are trying hard to get your attention
Climbing up your wall
Climbing up your wall
Don't go there, 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me, when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused, 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you
You were waiting for the elevator
You were saying, all the words I'm dreaming
No more asking, questions or excuses
Information's here, here and everywhere
Don't go there, 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me, when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused, 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, but
I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not, it's not your fault
I don't want anyone
As I do, it's not for you
Stockholders
Same shit, a different life
I'll get it right some time
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Can the dark side light my way out? Yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault
Please don't be long
'Cause I want your love
I don't have love
Without your arm
Life is too short
But I will live for you
How did this fit in your story? Yeah
Why'd you let them judge your body? Yeah
I'll be waiting there outside, yeah
Please don't be long
'Cause I want your arms
I don't have fun
Without your love
Life is too short
But I will live for you
You're back in love
But I will live for you my selfless love
I bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy
I'm not scared, just don't care
I'm not listening, you hear?
He's never there, I don't care
I can't tell you what and where
Yeah, yeah
One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break
Don't say it's in the bottle of air)
And first he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually, no thanks, I'm okay
Then he would send weird looks my way
I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was you, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me
And the eighties song, yeah, how did it go?
When they said, 
This is the beginning of the best years
Even though, false, break
One shot is never enough
I just wait for this to go into circles
And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?
I was thinking about that thing that you said last night, so boring
And the eighties bands? Oh, where did they go?
Can we switch into the chorus right now?
I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them? Or maybe all me?
Why, my new friends don't seem to want me
Hurts my case, but that's okay
It hurts my case, but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on
The deeper I get, the less that I know
That's the way that it go
The less that I know, the deeper I go
Juliet, I adore
The deeper I get, the less that I know
Diminishing returns
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, that's how it goes
All I want to say
Oh, another song
Oh, another day
Oh, another song
Oh, another day
Oh, another song
Oh, another break
Dropped down the lights, I'm sitting with you
Moscow, 1972
Always singin' in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Making bad decisions for you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
Makin' bad decisions for you
Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone
Oh baby, I hang on everything you say
I wanna write down every word
But do me a favor when you come close
When I look around, don't wanna see you
I don't take advice from fools
Never listenin' to you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Making bad decisions for you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
Makin' bad decisions for you
Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone
You, you didn't listen to me
But I, I didn't listen to you
I waited so long listening for
Something to work
I'm makin' bad decisions
Really, really bad decisions
I'm makin' bad decisions
On you, on you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not gonna give a lot of credit
I don't how to use how
'Cause I can't, I can't
I can't, can't make anymore(This, and I never let it happen)
(Hey, hey, oh)
(Hey, hey, oh)
When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day
(Hey, hey, oh)
Don't you want the truth?
Ignore reality
See I love that feeling too
Nobody's gonna stop right now
(Hey, hey, oh)
Summer is coming
Won't go away
Summer is coming
It's here to stay
(Hey, hey, oh)
I can't believe it
This is the 11th hour
Psychedelic
Life is such a funny journey
Hercules, your service is no longer needed
It's just like make believe
(Hey, hey, oh)
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
(Hey, hey, oh)
(Hey, hey, oh)
Now that you heard the truth
All I need a friendly face
I hate that feeling too
But no one's unafraid
(Hey, hey, oh)
Don't expect the truth
This is a fantasy
I fight that feeling too
But nobody's gonna stop us now
(Hey, hey, oh)
Summer is coming
Won't go away
Summer is coming
It's here to stay
(Hey, hey, oh)
Lo and behold the salt of the city
Pillars like time are fading away
Symphony building up to a future
Mystery to solve for somebody else
(Hey, hey, oh)
I can't believe it
Life is such a funny journey
Psychedelic
This is the 11th hour
Hercules, your service is no longer needed
It's just like make believe
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
Everybody's on the take
Tell me are you on the take too?
Everybody's on the take
Tell me are you on the take too?
(Hey, hey, oh)
(Hey, hey, oh)
(Hey, hey, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
(Hey, hey, oh, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
(Hey, hey, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
(Hey, hey, oh, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
I can't escape it
Never gonna make it out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you running for?
Run at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?
Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
You begged me not to go
Sinking like a stone
Use me like an oar
Get yourself to shore
Bang at the door
Anyone home?
That's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slamming through your wall
In their face, I saw
What they're fighting for
Can't escape it
I never gonna make it
Till the end, I guess
Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
Banging on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinking like a stone
So use me like an oar
Hard to fight what I can't see
Not trying to build no dynasty
I can see beyond this world
But we've lost this game so many times before
Lying on the cold floor
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
Lying on the cold floor
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to riseI sing a song
I paint a picture
My baby's gone
And I don't miss her
Like a swan
I don't miss swimming
All my friends left
And they don't miss me
Can't take it, babe
Your body talks to me
Like in a movie, babe
I let it resonate, yeah
I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)
I love you in the morning, so you know it's no lie
You're hiding in the background, but you wanna be found
You've got me on my back and now I've gotta think fast
You're hiding in the background, but you wanna be found
I take it easy, babe, I
I get down, it's automatic, I
I've come to believe in that
That too much time is evil
I transition in
I'm making your body wait
Like on an aeroplane
Please baby, take me away, yeah
I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)
I know
I know
I know
I know
I kinda miss the nine to five, yeah
Do those things that you can't hide
I scramble, fight just like a child
I'm staying hungry
I'm staying hungry
I'm staying hungry
I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry
I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry
Still staying hungry, yeah
Hold on, hold on, hold
The click was always in you Fab
It was never on
It was never onYou're not the same anymore
Don't wanna play that game anymore
You'd make a better window, than a door
Oh, the strangers they implore
It gets so easy to ignore
Just like the girl next door
Uncle's house, it was noon
Sorry boy, I can't employ ya
You are strange, but I like you
Sorry, this is overdue
I promised I would do it right
Her and a boy on a Saturday night
And now the door slams shut
A child prisoner grows up
To seek his enemy's throat cut
We're on the way, fuel the jet
Can see that what he wants, he gets
What does your sworn enemy regret?
I didn't know, I didn't care
I don't even understand
Did something wrong, I wasn't sure
Stay on top of this, or else
I was afraid, I fucked up, yeah yeah yeah
I couldn't change, it's too late
And now it's time to show up
Late again, I can't grow up
And now it's on me, they've given up
Uncle's house, I forget
Violent tendencies I get
Your timing sucks, she went overboard
Don't forget, you are insured
I didn't know, I wasn't sure
Can't remember all that well
I couldn't change, was too late, yeah yeah yeah
Up on his horse, up on his horse
Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time
It's not the truth
It's just a story
I tell to you
Easy to say
Easy to do
But it's not easy, well maybe for you?
Hope that you find it
Hope that it's good
Hope that you read it
Think that you should
Cuts you some slack, as he sits back
Sizes you up
Plans his attack
Drums please, Fab
And I got it all
I got it all waiting for me
Down on the street
But now you gotta do something special for me
I'm gonna say, what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out
Then I'll feel fine
Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there
I needed you there
But I didn't know
I didn't know
Go alone
I'll go alone
We'll go alone
I'll go alone
Back from his trip
He's at the door
When he gets back
He's on the phone
Innocent eye
Innocent heart
No, it's not wrong
But it's not right
Innocent time
Out on his own
Not gonna do that
Come out of control
I was just bored
Playing the guitar
Learned all your tricks
Wasn't too hard
It's the last one now
I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth
When I get back
Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom
Of the ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left
Is us, so pardon
The silence that you're hearing
Is turning into
A deafening, painful, shameful roarKnowing you
You'll wait for clear skies
To tell us how changes come about
With the sunlight
So we'll count every drop that falls
While you throw us some old line
This will pass, this will pass
And I'm spending your time
Wasting your time
You're with all you've ever wanted
And I'm spending your time
Wasting your time
You're with all you've ever wantedYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, you don't have to be so loud
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
Don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind
It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget
They're always scared of where their daughters been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again?
Is it gone?
Don't have to lick my face
Everyone can see that you're a psycho in displace
That the next generation will forget
Where their daughters been
Or who knows they could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what it is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and talk and hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face again
It's no ones fault
Is it gone?
Gone
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again?
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's gone
Whether you're in L.A.
Sunny laid back L.A.
Whether you're in New York
Comfort 'round your block
Whether you're in the U.K.
Where the sky is dark
And the grass is kinda green
You know like Central Park
Still my favorite place in this whole wide world
Has got to be in the middle of the ocean floor
I see you poking out of the ocean, Paradise on Earth
The 50th state - WHAT?!
Hawaii
Ooooooh Oooh
Ooooh Oooh Oooh
I wanna live in somewhere different. Oh oh oh
A nuclear disaster might be on our way
But I don't care, I'm in the U.S.A
Whether we're drunk or stoned
or we're sober and old
if I'm with you I'm a happy man
If you feel safe and cold
while you count your gold
If your problem is you can't find
your remote control
Still my favorite person in this whole wide world
Is the woman who can understand every word
And when she speaks to me
She makes me see the world
As my favorite place...
Hawaii
We got it made
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Yes, I know
Can we go
By plane or boat
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Whether you take it slow or you let me go
Whether you tell me something that I did not know
Whether you're neat and polite or you scream and fight
Whether you keep something from me that I would not like
Still my favourite attitude in this world so far
Is the friendly spirit of an iron heart
I like the way folks are in this most special place
I don't care what happens I'm taking a plane
Hawaii
I said
Hawaii
I said
Hawaii
I said
Hawaii
Kauai or Oahu
Molokai or Lanai
Maui and the big guy,
A.k.a. Hawaii
Hawaii
Hawaii
Ooooooh Oooh
Ooooh Oooh Oooh
All I want to do is something different
Oh let me in
Cut off from Malaysia
Back in who knows when
Oh we got
kinda lost
But my God
What a place!
I profess
Airforce Jets
Cannot take
Away my soul
Ten decisions shape your life
You'll be aware of 5 about
7 ways to go through school
Either you're noticed or left out
7 ways to get ahead
7 reasons to drop out
When I said 'I can see me in your eyes'
You said 'I can see you in my bed'
That's not just friendship that's romance too
You like music we can dance to
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you
There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Some they just take it out on friends
Oh everybody plays the game
And if you don't you're called insane
Don't don't don't don't it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
Soon you were born
In 1984
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you
Everybody was well dressed
And everybody was a mess
6 things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh all the girls played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same
Why not try it all
If you only remember it once
Oooh ooooooh
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you
Well I lived this life, I was just seventeen
And this house was built on mama's broken dreams
I put it all aside
When she looked me in the eye
Oh
And arrest these teachers for what they have read
And give all your money to the living dead
Like a call girl in her prime
Arriving just in time
Oh
I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Oh he does it to
Get you by your side
A new way to wave goodbye
And I'm waiting
My lady!
And I'm redefining what they could not perceive
Upon their big arrival and they cheat on three
And he took them to his side
And no they could not wait to hide
I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Oh he does it to
Keep you by your side
A new way to say goodbye
And I'm waiting
My lady!
And I lived this life, I was just seventeen
And this house was built on mama's broken dreams
I put it all aside
And she looked me in the eye
Was I gone for too long?
Did I say something wrong or right?
You were
Modern girls always have to go
(Right on time)
Old-fashioned men always want a mistress
(You were right)
Modern girls always get their way 
(I was wrong)
Modern men dream of what they can't say 
(That's alright) Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? 
I don't belong (I don't belong)
Why you gotta say it if you know it's something wrong? 
(Why're you sitting over there?)
Says that he'll apologize and it won't take too long 
Well you don't wanna trust nobody else
(Always thinking 'bout yourself)
(Time)
There's a few things that are gonna have to change
(I'm your son)
Everyone has the same opinion
(Won't you please?)
Your time is almost over
(Don't be mean)
We won't get the chance to do this over 
(That's alright) Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? 
I don't belong (I don't belong)
I don't want the imprint of your key upon my nose 
(Why're you sitting over there?)
You don't have to tell no one 'cause no one wants to know 
That you don't have no happiness at all 
(Always thinking 'bout yourself)
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down) 
Oh yes, we're falling down (Oh yes, we're falling down)
So fucking help me up
Always thinking 'bout yourself
(You don't love me)
Always thinking 'bout yourself
(I am an animal)
Always thinking 'bout yourself
(I am not practical)
Was I? Oh! I meant - Ah!
No, I didn't mean that at all
Here in the streets of American nights
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules, and I want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fuckin' strange
Nina's in the bedroom
She says, Time to go now
But leavin' it ain't easy
I've got to let go
Oh, I've got to let go
And the hours they went to slow
I said every night
She just can't stop sayin'
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
Just kill me now 'cause I'll let you down
I swear one day we're gonna leave this town
Stop
Yes, I'm leaving 'cause this just won't work
They act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Soft time in your prime
See me, I like the summertime
But hey
Nina's in the bedroom
She says, Time to go now
But leaving it ain't easy
Oh, I've got to let go
I've got to let go
Oh, trapped in an apartment
She would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter,
I've got to come clean
The authorities, they've seen
Darling, I'm somewhere in between
I said every night
She just can't stop sayin'
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
